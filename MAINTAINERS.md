Hello! It’s me! The developer of the Kanban plugin.

I no longer have the bandwidth to maintain the Kanban plugin (and haven’t for a while) and I’m looking for new maintainers to take over the project. Ideally there’s be at least two so we can get some collaboration and a mutual review process going.

Some things to note:

- The plugin’s code is kind of a mess in spots. I built this while I was a stressed out grad student and often “good enough” was good enough. I’ve always been meaning to come back and improve the code quality.
- The plugin’s code is fairly complex, and LLMs may struggle with parts of it. You should be able to code without the use of LLMs to reduce the amount of bugs that might arise during development.
- **New maintainers should respect the community.** The Kanban plugin has a large user base. While you might want “cool feature X” the community might not. Please work with the community rather than imposing your vision on them.

If you’re interested, the best way to reach me is through Obsidian’s Discord server. You can DM me there @mgmeyers.
