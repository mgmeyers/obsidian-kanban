## Add date and time to archived cards

When active, a time stamp will be added to cards when they are archived. By default, this is placed at the beginning of the card, but it can be placed at the end using the [[Add archive date/time after card title]] setting. The timestamp can be separated from the card's content using the [[Archive date time separator]] setting. The date format can be controlled with the [[Archive date time format]] setting.
