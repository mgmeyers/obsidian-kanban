By default, a Kanban board's [[View a Kanban's archive|archive]] will grow infinitely. Setting the maximum number of archived cards will cap the archive at the specified number. 

For example, if `Maximum number of archived cards` is set to `100`, the archive will never contain more than 100 cards. When the archive reaches its maximum, old cards will be deleted as new cards are added.
